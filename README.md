# What is this?
This is an application of mine created for my TTRPG called "Nova Era" (at the time of this README, it has 100 sessions!)

It's a character sheet for a custom RPG System to play with my friends. The DuetCrown System.

# Why did I create it?
I love creating stories and games. So, of course, I love creating TTRPG systems.

I could just write an article about the system, create a docs/excel sheet and called it a day... But, it would be lame.

It would be lame to not utilize my coding skills in it.

This is the second character sheet I've created for this TTRPG. The first one was a not so good godot app (with a different system of DuetCrown).

But, when comes the end of an arc, and preferring to make a web sheet, changing the system, and creating a new UI, it was naturally to start this new project.
